Project Setup and Tech Stack:

    1.Used React.js for building the user interface and plain CSS for styling, focusing on simplicity and clarity.
    2.Integrated Open Library API to fetch book data based on user search inputs.
    3.Deployed the app on GitHub Pages or another hosting service, enabling easy access for both evaluators and the user.

Key Features:

    1.Search Functionality: Alex can search for books by title, author, or ISBN. The app leverages Open Library's search endpoint to fetch relevant results.
    2.User Interface: Designed a straightforward, user-centered UI, emphasizing a clean and organized layout. Optimized for easy book browsing and discovery, with a responsive design for different devices.
    3.Details View: Clicking on a book brings up additional details like author, publish date, and cover image if available.
    
Development Approach:

    1.Component-Based Architecture: Built reusable React components, such as header, ResultCrid, and BookCard, for modularity and maintainability.
    2.State Management: Used React’s state and props to handle the data flow between components, ensuring each component updates seamlessly with new API responses.
    3.CSS Styling: Implemented CSS to provide a polished look, focusing on readability and accessibility. Kept the styles lightweight to improve loading times and responsiveness.
    
Challenges and Solutions:

    1.Data Fetching and Error Handling: Managed API request errors gracefully, providing feedback if there are issues with the user’s input or network problems.
    2.Search Optimization: Implemented debouncing to minimize API calls during typing, improving the user experience by reducing lag.
    3.Responsive Design: Ensured the app is accessible and looks good on various devices, as college students like Alex may access it on phones or laptops.

Future Improvements:

    1.Add features such as a book-saving function, allowing users to save their favorite books.
    2.Implement pagination for better handling of large search results.
